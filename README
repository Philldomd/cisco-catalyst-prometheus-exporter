# cisco-dna-prometheus-exporter
This repository is a direct reimplementation of [Hawar Koyi](https://hawar.no/2021/05/cisco-dna-center-with-grafana-dashboard/) DNA dashboard but in Golang. This does not require any database, instead it will call the healt and metric ports upon scraping and deliver the information in prometheus format.
